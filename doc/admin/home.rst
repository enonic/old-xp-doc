Launcher panel
--------------

The **Launcher panel** lists the installed admin tools in alphabetical order. These will open in a new tab when selected, but a long
left-click will open the selected tool in the same tab. The bottom of the Launcher Panel shows current user and the logout button.

.. tip:: Admin tools are user-definable. Read more about how to create your own :ref:`tools`.
