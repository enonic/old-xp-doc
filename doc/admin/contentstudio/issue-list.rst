Default view shows the list of open issues.
Filter on top of the list can be used to narrow down the list to only the issues assigned to your user or created by your user. You can also
switch to the list of closed issues by clicking the link to the right of the two checkboxes.
If there are issues assigned to your user or issues created by your user, the filter will be automatically preset when you open the dialog.
Black circles next to each issue indicate assignees the issue is assigned to.
Clicking an issue will open the :ref:`issue_details` dialog.
"**New Issue**" button opens the :ref:`New Issue dialog <issue_create>`.
