The dialog has three tabs: Comments, Items and Assignees.

Comments
--------

The first tab of the Issue details dialog shows the list of comments. If the issue was created with the description it will be listed as the first comment.
Each comment has a menu icon where you will find buttons to edit or delete the comment. You can add a new comment by typing in text into the textfield at the bottom
of the tab and pressing the "Add Comment" button.
"Close Issue" button will close the issue without publishing it.

On the second tab of the Issue details dialog you will find the list of content items and their dependencies. You can modify the list by adding new content to the issue
or removing existing items from the issue. By clicking the "Publish & Close Issue" you will publish all of the items with dependencies and the issue will be closed. You
can schedule publishing using the Publish button's dropdown menu.
