Content Editor
==============

The **Content Editor** opens in a new browser tab from the :ref:`browse_view` when a content is created or edited. Multiple content
tabs can be open at the same time. Clicking on the Content Studio tree icon in the top left corner will open :ref:`browse_view`
in a new browser tab. User will get a browser warning upon trying to close a tab with modified but unsaved content.

The edit view consists of several parts. On the left is the :ref:`content_form`. If content is editable, the :ref:`page_editor` will
automatically open on the right. Expandable :ref:`context_panel` and :ref:`components_panel` can be open from inside the Page Editor.
Inspection panel will be placed to the right of the Page Editor or expand over it, based on screen resolution. The Components view will
always hover over the Page Editor.
