Content Studio
==============

The Content Studio is the Web CMS interface of Enonic XP. It is used for managing and publishing content. It also provides the tools for
building and extending web applications from the components of the installed apps.

Opening the Content Studio reveals the :ref:`browse_view` with a menu bar, content tree grid, preview panel and details panel. The **Edit
view** appears when content is created or edited and will open in a new browser tab. All actions and features will be described in the following pages.

.. HINT::
   The Content Studio is fully responsive, so panels may stack or collapse if the screen is small or narrow. This
   documentation will assume a large desktop view.
