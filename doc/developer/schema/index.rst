Schemas
=======

As the low level storage of Enonic XP is entirely schema-less, we have created a high-level schema concept that is used to configure many of the forms you see in the Enonic XP Admin.

Schemas are made up of the following main concepts:

* A rich set of widgets called :ref:`input_types`
* Rich :ref:`schema_forms` by combining Input Types and layouts
* Horizontal inheritance across forms through the use of :ref:`mixins`
