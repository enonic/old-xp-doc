Localization
============

Enonic XP provides a standard approach to code localizations, simply by adding resource bundles to your applications, and actively using the ``localize``
functions in "controllers" and "views".  Detailed documentation for this function is found here: :ref:`portal-localize`.

To see how this is used in a controller, see ``lib-i18n`` in :ref:`js-libraries`.

The labels and texts used in content types, input types and other schemas can also be localized. See how to localize them in :ref:`localization_schemas`.
