ID Providers
============

An ID Provider is a pluggable authentication module, contained inside an application.
Install an existing ID Provider or write your own, configure it and associate it to a user store.


Set up an ID Provider
---------------------

To set up an ID Provider, you must follow the 3 steps below:

#. An application containing an ID Provider must be installed and started (Use the admin tool :ref:`application_tool`).
#. The application must be associated to a user store and configured (Use the admin tool :ref:`users_tool` and edit the user store to guard).
#. The user store must be associated to a virtual host in the virtual host configuration file (see :ref:`configuration-vhost`).


Create an ID Provider
---------------------

To create an ID provider, you must create a new folder in your project structure, i.e.  ``idprovider``.
Then you must place a descriptor and a controller there.

Descriptor
^^^^^^^^^^

The ID Provider descriptor is a required XML file used to define the mode and the configuration required by the provider.
The descriptor file must have the following path: ``idprovider/idprovider.xml``:

.. literalinclude:: code/descriptor.xml
   :language: xml

mode
  Specifies how the provider uses the user store.

  LOCAL: Both the users and groups are stored locally in the user store.

  EXTERNAL: Both the users and groups are stored in a remote system.
  The user store is only a snapshot view of this remote system and therefore the users and groups are not editable in the admin tool :ref:`users_tool`.

  MIXED: The users are stored in a remote system and the groups in the user store.
  The users in the user store are only a snapshot view of this remote system and therefore the users are not editable in the admin tool :ref:`users_tool`.

config
  Specifies the input fields of the configuration required by the ID provider.


Controller
^^^^^^^^^^

The controller is a required file written in JavaScript and must have the following path: ``idprovider/idprovider.js``:

.. literalinclude:: code/controller.js
   :language: javascript

handle401
  Optional function rendered in the case of a 401 error.
  This function typically produces a login or error page.

get/post/...
  Functions rendered. An ID provider controller exports a method for each type of HTTP request that should be handled.
  The portal function ``idProviderUrl()`` will create a dynamic URL to this function.

login
  Function rendered.
  The portal function ``loginUrl()`` will create a dynamic URL to this function.

logout
  Function rendered.
  The portal function ``logoutUrl()`` will create a dynamic URL to this function.

autoLogin
  Optional function executed if the current user is unauthenticated.
  This functions allows you to, for example, handle web tokens or other request headers.
