HTTP Cookies
============

There are two ways that Http Cookie values can be set in responses (see examples).

* If the value is a string (1) then the cookie is created using default settings.
* If the value is an object (2) then it will try to apply the settings. Every field is optional except "value".

Here's an example of how the cookies should be set:

.. literalinclude:: code/cookies.js
    :language: javascript

Settings
--------

Overview of full JS object and the settings can be found here. A full in-depth into how each parameter works can be found in the `Java documentation for Cookies`_. Also, `general knownledge of Cookies`_ and their limitations is adviced.

value (required)
  The value to store in the cookie. The example (2) in the code above would create a cookie looking like this ``complex: value``.

path
  The paths on the site this cookie should be available from (and all containing paths).  
  
  *Default:* ``empty`` (The current URL path.)
  
domain
  Add additional sites that should be able to read the cookie.  
  
  *Default:* ``empty`` (Only the server that creates the cookie can read it.)

comment
  A comment describing the cookie.  
  
  *Default:* ``null``

maxAge
  Number of **seconds** before the browser is allowed to delete the cookie.  
  
  *Default:* ``-1`` (The cookie will live until the browser is shut down.)
  
secure
  Control if the cookie should only be accepted to be created and read over https and similar secure protocols.  

  *Default:* ``false``

httpOnly
  Control if the cookie is available for scripts or not. If `true`, only the serverside code can read the cookie.  
    
  *Default:* ``false`` (Also client-side scripts can read the cookie.)
