How is Enonic XP Licensed
-------------------------
Enonic XP is available under the `GPL 3.0 license <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`_.
This basically means that you are free to use and re-distribute Enonic XP according to the GPL license.
The linking exception ensures that you can build custom applications and libraries on top of Enonic XP and license these however you see fit.
Any changes made to the Enonic XP core platform however must be licensed as PGL.

We encourage the use of FOSS licensing for 3rd party apps and libraries. Libraries in particular should be licensed with a non-intrusive license such as Apache, BSD or MIT.

.. note:: This is a major difference from products such as Drupal and Wordpress where your themes, plugins and modules must be licensed as GPL too.


Enonic XP also consists of many 3rd party software components. The complete list can be found in our `Notice.txt file <https://github.com/enonic/xp/blob/master/NOTICE.txt>`_

What is $XP_INSTALL?
--------------------

**$XP_INSTALL** and **$XP_HOME** are referenced frequently in the documentation and it is important
to understand the difference. $XP_INSTALL is the top level directory of the XP installation and it
contains the directories `bin`, `home`, `lib`, `toolbox` and others.

What is $XP_HOME?
-----------------

**$XP_HOME**, by default, is the location of the $XP_INSTALL/home folder which contains the `config`, `deploy`, `repo` and other
directories specific to a single XP instance. The home folder can be copied to multiple locations
for developers working on more than one project.

There are two situations where the **$XP_HOME environment variable** must be set:

#. When developers are working on an application and intend to use `./gradlew deploy`.

#. When a `home` folder other than $XP_INSTALL/home is to be used.
