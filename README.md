# Enonic XP Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/xp/badge/?version=latest)](http://xp.readthedocs.org/)

This repository contains Enonic XP documentation. The documentation is
written using Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html) and are hosted
on Read-the-docs (https://readthedocs.org/).

## Requirements

If you want to build the documentation you have to ensure that you
have the following required software:

* Python
* Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html)
* Preferably a Linux (or Mac) OS

## Building

Read-the-docs (https://readthedocs.org/) will build automatically, but
it's nice to build locally for verification. Build using make:

    make html

To build on windows:

    sphinx-build -b html doc build
